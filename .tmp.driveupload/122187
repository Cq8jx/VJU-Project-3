## Chapter 1: Leveraging Google Workspace

This chapter explains how to improve efficiency and collaboration using standard GWS features without AI. Because all services run in the cloud, users can access up-to-date information regardless of location or device.

### 1.1 Organizational Communication with Google Groups
- **Overview:** Google Groups functions as a mailing list, message board, and collaborative inbox, centralizing communication for departments, committees, and project teams. Threads are accessible on the web in addition to email.
- **Integration with Other Services:** Assign the group address to Google Calendar invitations and shared drives so that schedules, materials, and tasks stay synchronized with membership changes.
- **Member Management:** Administrators can add or remove members by role and process changes in bulk for transfers and enrollment. Dynamic groups automate maintenance based on organizational units, and access to shared drives and calendars is updated automatically in sync with membership operations.
- **Collaborative Inbox:** Enable the collaborative inbox to assign tickets and track their status—the same workflow adopted by customer support and IT help desks in the private sector—so the team can distribute inquiries from students and staff.
- **Use Cases:** Course announcements, school-wide notifications, committee minutes, research collaboration, student project Q&A, and more.
- **Archive:** Messages accumulate in a searchable archive that supports transitions, audits, and knowledge sharing. Even if emails are deleted from personal inboxes, the group maintains the history.
- **Moderation:** Configure approval workflows, spam filters, and keyword-based holds to control information quality. This is particularly helpful when using Groups as a student inquiry board.
- **Notification Preferences:** Members can choose how frequently they receive mail (all messages, digest, or none) to avoid notification overload while keeping essential updates.
- **Labels and Categories:** Apply labels or categorize threads to improve searchability and build an FAQ-style knowledge hub.
- **Reporting:** Use the Google Workspace admin console to review access logs and audit reports, monitoring for unauthorized access or potential data leaks.
- **Security:** Grant finely controlled permissions to external members (view-only, no posting, etc.), and enforce second-stage approvals or expiry dates for sensitive information.
- **Reference:** [Manage Google Groups (Google Groups Help)](https://support.google.com/groups?hl=ja)

### 1.2 File Sharing and Shared Drive Operations

## Chapter 2: Leveraging Generative AI (Gemini and More)

This chapter explains how to use Google’s Gemini services to support writing, analysis, and application development. Each service is introduced with an overview, onboarding steps, use cases, and prompt examples.

For the Gemini offering provided within VJU’s Google Workspace environment, contractual terms guarantee that user inputs are **not** reused as Google’s training data. As long as you access Gemini with your campus account, prompts are processed in the organization’s dedicated environment and are not fed back into model training.

### 2.1 Principles for Using Generative AI
1. **Clarify Goals and Constraints:** Include goals, target audience, output format, and prohibitions in the prompt.
2. **Stage Your Requests:** Break large tasks into smaller steps and ask the AI sequentially to increase accuracy.
3. **Verification Process:** Always review outputs, verify citations and numbers, and ensure compliance with laws and policies.
4. **Security:** Mask or summarize personal data and unpublished research before sharing with AI.
5. **Data Classification:** Define the level of sensitivity and what kinds of data are allowed in prompts ahead of time.
6. **Prompt Management:** Record both successful and failed prompts to build organizational knowledge and iterate.
7. **Human-in-the-loop:** Keep humans in charge of critical decisions and use AI as an assistant.
8. **Pilot Projects:** Run small PoCs, validate success metrics and risks, then scale campus-wide.
9. **Rights and Ethics:** Address copyright, research ethics, and bias. Establish and communicate usage policies.
10. **Continuous Learning:** Analyze logs and feedback, and update prompts and training materials regularly.

Documenting prompts and reference materials in Markdown—a human-readable and AI-friendly text format—simplifies version control, reuse, and integration with NotebookLM or RAG workflows.
